# Simple React blog post website 

Thank you very much for visiting this page. I hope this proect helps you to see a part of my ability to code ! 

*This website is focued on React.js. Therefore, the design side of this website is less focused.*

*In order to check the website with CRUD operation with json-server(after you clone this repo),
1. type "npm start" in Terminal 
2. type "npx json-server -p 3500 -w Data/db.json" to run json-server in Terminal

Here are some of the main features that I used in this project: 
1. CRUD operation with RestAPI by JSON server by means of Axios with async/await
2. React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useHistory, useContext)
3. State Management with useContext
4. Custom Hook to create reusable components
5. Canceltoken
6. React Routing  etc.
