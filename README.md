# Simple React blog post website 

Thank you very much for visiting this page. I hope this proect helps you to see a part of my ability to code ! 

*This website is focued on React.js. Therefore, the design side of this website is less contributed.*

*please also start json-server by typing "npx json-server -p 3500 -w Data/db.json" in terminal to check CRUD operation that is created in this website.*

Here are some of the main features that I used in this project: 
1. CRUD operation with RestAPI by JSON server by means of Axios with async/await
2. React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useHistory, useContext)
3. State Management with useContext
4. Custom Hook to create reusable components
5. Canceltoken
6.React Routing  etc.
